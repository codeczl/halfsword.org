# Half Sword Game Guide: Beginner's Handbook and Advanced Techniques

## Introduction

**Half Sword** is an immersive medieval combat simulation game where players take on the role of a commoner striving to become a knight through brutal 15th-century European tournaments. This guide aims to help beginners get started and provide advanced strategies for seasoned players.

## Basic Operations

- **Movement and Camera Control**:  
  Use `WASD` keys for movement, `Shift` to sprint, and `Ctrl` to crouch. The mouse controls the camera, allowing for quick adjustments during combat.

- **Weapon Handling**:  
  Press `Q` and `E` to use weapons in the left and right hands. Hold the keys to sheathe weapons. Open the inventory with `R` and select weapons using the mouse.

- **Attacking and Defending**:  
  Perform attacks by moving the mouse to simulate slashing motions. Monitor your stamina bar—depleting it will cause the screen to darken, requiring a balanced attack strategy.

## Beginner’s Guide

1. **Familiarize Yourself with the Interface**:  
   Explore the game menu and settings to understand key functionalities. Watching a tutorial video is recommended.

2. **Master Basic Combat Techniques**:  
   Practice stable stances to improve your aim and attack accuracy. Study enemy patterns to identify weak points.

3. **Progress Gradually**:  
   Early levels are designed to introduce game mechanics. Focus on learning enemy attack patterns and weaknesses.

## Advanced Techniques

- **Weapon Selection and Customization**:  
  Choose weapons based on enemy types. For lightly armored foes, use short swords; for heavily armored enemies, opt for longswords or polearms.

- **Targeting Weak Points**:  
  Aim for vulnerable areas, such as the neck or eye slits in helmets, to defeat opponents quickly.

- **Tactical Movement**:  
  Use techniques like sidesteps and crouches to avoid attacks and create openings. Maintain an optimal distance to prevent being surrounded.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **Why does the combat feel clunky?**  
  Beginners may find the mechanics challenging. Consistent practice will improve fluidity and control.
