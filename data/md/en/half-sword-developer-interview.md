## Introduction

**Half Sword** is an immersive, physics-based medieval combat game that allows players to experience the journey from a commoner to a knight, engaging in brutal tournaments set in 15th-century Europe. To gain deeper insights into the development process and future plans for the game, we interviewed the team at Half Sword Games.

## Inspiration Behind the Game

**Q: What inspired you to develop *Half Sword*?**

**A:** Our passion for medieval history and martial arts was the primary driving force. We noticed a gap in the market for games that authentically simulate medieval combat, especially concerning the physics of weapons and armor. This realization led us to create *Half Sword*, aiming to provide players with a genuine 15th-century combat experience.

## Challenges During Development

**Q: What were the main challenges faced during development?**

We collaborated with experts in Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) to ensure each movement and reaction was authentic. Balancing historical accuracy with engaging gameplay also required careful consideration.

## Future Plans

**Q: What are your future plans for *Half Sword*?**

**A:** We plan to officially release the game in 2025. Before that, we'll utilize Steam's Early Access to gather player feedback. Future updates will introduce more weapons, armor, and new game modes. We're also exploring the addition of multiplayer features to facilitate player-versus-player combat and cooperative gameplay.

## Role of the Player Community

**Q: How does the player community influence your development process?**

**A:** Player feedback is invaluable to us. Through community platforms, we've received numerous suggestions regarding game balance, functionality, and content. This input helps us continuously refine the game to meet player expectations.

## Conclusion

This interview sheds light on the dedication and passion driving the development of *Half Sword*. We eagerly anticipate its official release in 2025, confident it will offer players an unparalleled medieval combat experience.
