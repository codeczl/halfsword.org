# Half Sword: An Immersive Medieval Combat Simulation Game Introduction

## Game Background and Development Purpose

Developed by Half Sword Games, Half Sword is a medieval combat simulation game rooted in 15th-century European history. The game aims to deliver an authentic experience through its physics-based combat system and historically accurate weapon designs.

## Core Features

- **Physics-Based Combat System**  
  Players can control the sword's movements using a mouse, offering precise, realistic feedback for every swing, block, and strike.

  The game features a wide array of medieval weapons and armor, all designed based on historical references, allowing players to customize their combat style.

  Modes include single-player tournaments, one-on-one duels, and team battles, challenging players to adapt strategies and refine their skills.
